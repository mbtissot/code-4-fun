# Code 4 Fun

This is repository is supposed to have all the coding exercises i do across various sites. I try to code some stuff everyday, at least 10 minutes, so if i don't have any idea of what to do throughout the day (studying physics if great to get lots of ideas of what to code), i will usually head to some website with coding exercises, such as [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) or [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com).

### Languages

The languages i try to use for these exercises are mainly Python and Fortran90 (which i am trying to learn to be effective at scientific computing), but if (when) i try to learn a new language, i will for sure use these resources.
